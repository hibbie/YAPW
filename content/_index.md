Hi there.  I'm a developer from Lake Jackson, Texas.  Since 2006 I've worked as a developer in various industries.  My primary focus has been on web development but I have tinkered in this or that over the years.  Please feel free to reach out via [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hibbie/) for any professional inquiries. 

This site is just mostly meant as a digital business card.  I was building a site in Gatsby.js and naturally became bored and built this using Hugo one evening for fun.
